  <summary><strong>üì¶ Product Description and Main Aim</strong></summary>
  &nbsp;
  
&emsp;&emsp;This project aims to develop a web-based mental health decision support system that integrates standardized psychological tests with machine learning models. Through a two-stage AI pipeline, the system will first analyze user-submitted test scores, then transform them to more academic baseline. After that it will generate evidence-based probability distribution on mental illness types to support clinicians in their decision-making process. The project follows an agile development methodology over three sprints, focusing on model training, interface design, and clearity. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver a functional prototype tailored for psychiatrists and psychologists, offering a lightweight yet scientifically grounded evaluation tool.

  <summary><strong>üîç Product Features</strong></summary>

  - Standardized Test Input
Clinicians will recieve extracted results from an algorithm. 

- Machine Learning-Based Evaluation
Those test responses are processed by a trained ML model to classify mental health risk levels with consistency and accuracy.

- AI-Generated Interpretation
An LLM or rule-based system provides brief, understandable, and clinically relevant summaries of the test outcome.

- Risk Level Visualization
Results are displayed with visual indicators (e.g., low / moderate / high risk), enabling quick comprehension.

- Data Privacy & Security
The system ensures that all patient inputs remain anonymous and are processed in accordance with ethical standards.

- Web-Based Interface
Doctors can access the system via a clean, user-friendly interface‚Äîno installation required.
