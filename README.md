  <summary><strong>📦 Product Description and Main Aim</strong></summary>
  &nbsp;
  
&emsp;&emsp;This project aims to develop a web-based mental health decision support system that integrates standardized psychological tests with machine learning models. Through a two-stage AI pipeline, the system will first analyze user-submitted test scores, then transform them to more academic baseline. After that it will generate evidence-based probability distribution on mental illness types to support clinicians in their decision-making process. The project follows an agile development methodology over three sprints, focusing on model training, interface design, and clearity. Ultimately, the goal is to deliver a functional prototype tailored for psychiatrists and psychologists, offering a lightweight yet scientifically grounded evaluation tool.

  <summary><strong>🔍 Product Features</strong></summary>

  - Standardized Test Input
Clinicians will recieve extracted results from an algorithm. 

- Machine Learning-Based Evaluation
Those test responses are processed by a trained ML model to classify mental health risk levels with consistency and accuracy.

- AI-Generated Interpretation
An LLM or rule-based system provides brief, understandable, and clinically relevant summaries of the test outcome.

- Risk Level Visualization
Results are displayed with visual indicators (e.g., low / moderate / high risk), enabling quick comprehension.

- Data Privacy & Security
The system ensures that all patient inputs remain anonymous and are processed in accordance with ethical standards.

- Web-Based Interface
Doctors can access the system via a clean, user-friendly interface—no installation required.

- Modular & Extendable
The product is built to support new tests, models, and languages, allowing for future clinical use cases.

### 🚀 Sprint 1

#### 📝 Notes:
- Team name, member roles, and project name were finalized.  
- GitHub repository was created with a structured folder setup.  
- Product mission, vision, and core values were written.  
- The color palette and font selection process started; a draft version was decided.
- First front-end of the site built.
- Figma-based logos were prepared.  
- A user flow diagram (from test input to result report) was created on draw.io.  
- Initial logo concept was developed.      
- Sprint 1 report was written and finalized.  

#### 🎯 Total Points / How We Decide:
- **Target:** 90 points  
- **Completed:** 90 points  
- Points are distributed based on task complexity and estimated effort.  
- Sprint 1 target is lower due to the initialization part of the project.

#### 🔄 Daily Scrum:
- Conducted daily with the messages and weekly voice calls. 

 
- 🚧 **In Progress:**
  - Website development  
  - Data cleaning  
- ⏭️ **Upcoming:**
  - Model architecture setup  
  - Form structure & JSON transformation  
  - Answer-to-score algorithm

#### 🔍 Review:
- The team exceeded point expectations.  
- Strong collaboration was observed during UI and flow planning.  
- Decision processes for design (color/logo) took more time than expected.  
- Clear direction was set for Sprint 2 deliverables.
